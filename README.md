# Formula-1 Data Analysis
---
Project Purpose
---
The following project consisted in analazing historical data of Formula 1 seasons and races in Microsoft SQL Server . I personally am  a fan of Formula 1 and wanted to explore the historical data to see drivers performcances. Therefore, I found this database intersting to apply my SQL skills and also discovering one of the sports I enjoy the most.    

Goal
---
To allow viewers to observe different metrics of F1 drivers, races, and seasons in the last twenty years, but specifically in recent years.

Deliverable
---
SQL queries using joins, subqueries, CASE, and aggregate functions that show F1 metrics.

Results
---
The queries showed that three former world champions are the ones with more points accumulated in the history of F1. These drivers are Lewis Hamilton, Sebastian Vettel, and Fernando Alonso. However, when it comes to races won, Michael Schumacher enters the top 3 list, moving Fernando Alonso to the 6th place. Additionally, it was explored how Lewis Hamilton's wins were distributed between Mercedes and Mclaren. Other metrics were explored for individual races or drivers such as Monaco GP, Canada GP, and Fernando Alosno's DNFs in season 2021.
